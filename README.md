Announcing ThreatMapper 1.4

ThreatMapper 1.4.0 adds ThreatGraph, a rich visualization that uses runtime context such as network flows to prioritize threat scan results. ThreatGraph enables organizations to narrow down attack path alerts from thousands to a handful of the most meaningful (and threatening). Release 1.4.0 also adds agentless cloud security posture management (CSPM) of cloud assets and agent-based posture management of hosts, evaluating posture against industry-standard compliance benchmarks.

ThreatMapper - Runtime Threat Management and Attack Path Enumeration for Cloud Native

Deepfence ThreatMapper hunts for threats in your production platforms, and ranks these threats based on their risk-of-exploit. It uncovers vulnerable software components, exposed secrets and deviations from good security practice. ThreatMapper uses a combination of agent-based inspection and agent-less monitoring to provide the widest possible coverage to detect threats.

With ThreatMapper's ThreatGraph visualization, you can then identify the issues that present the greatest risk to the security of your applications, and prioritize these for planned protection or remediation.

When to use ThreatMapper

ThreatMapper carries on the good 'shift left' security practices that you already employ in your development pipelines. It continues to monitor running applications against emerging software vulnerabilities, and monitors the host and cloud configuration against industry-expert bnechmarks.

Use ThreatMapper to provide security observability for your production workloads and infrastructure, across cloud, kubernetes, serverless (Fargate) and on-prem platforms.
